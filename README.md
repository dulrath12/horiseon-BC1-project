# Code Refactoring

## Description

The goal of this project was to refactor existing code so that it meets accessibility standards. In order for the existing code to meet those standards there were several different things that i need to change including:

1. I started out by changing all of the existing (div) tags into the corresponding Semantic tags that would apply to each of them. 
2. I then added a concise title to the (title) section that i thought was appropriate for the website.
3. After that I proceeded to find every (img) element and make sure that each one had a descriptive (alt) so that screen readers and/or other accessibility tools would be of better use.
4. Next I went through both the HTML, and CSS, finding what classes were redundant and/or repeated, and managed to consolidate them into one single class making the CSS page less crowded and better looking, along with the HTML.
5. I also decided to add an additional (a href) to the header so that if additional pages were ever created the (h1) of the header could be used to return to the original page
6. Lastly, and finally, I looked over all of the HTML Code, as well as CSS code, and deployed the webpage in the browser to ensure that everything was in working order, and that nothing had been missed.
